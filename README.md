##gall
game of life implementation which had the gall to show me the horror of bash
scripting and unix pypes during testing.

input files need to be formatted specifically with full-stop and crunch characters,
dots representing dead cells and crunches representing live ones. width and
height must equal whatever is set in the file, by default 30x30.

*future updates?
*file output
*arguments for size of simulation grid
